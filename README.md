Code Challenge 1 Rules:

1. You may not use any external libraries to solve this problem, but you may use external libraries or tools for building or testing purposes. Specifically, you may use unit-testing libraries or build tools available like JUnit, Maven, Gradle etc.
2. Please include a brief explanation of your design and assumptions, along with your code, as well as detailed instructions to run your application.
3. We assess several things including the design aspect of your solution and your object-oriented programming skills. While these are small problems, we expect you to submit what you believe is production-quality code; well-tested code that you’d be able to run, maintain, and evolve. You don’t need to gold plate your solution; however, we are looking for something more than a bare bones algorithm Notes on Deliverables:
4. For the solution, we request that you use Java.
5. There must be a way to supply the application with the input data via text file wherever applicable
6. You should provide sufficient evidence that your solution is complete by indicating that it works correctly against the supplied test data • The code must run using Java 8+ VMs • All code should have unit tests

Challenge 1 We have an input file with a list of strings in a random order. The data needs to be displayed column wise.
